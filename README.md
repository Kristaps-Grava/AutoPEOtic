**About AutoPEOtic**

AutoPEOtic automatises plasma electrolyctic oxidation process (PEO) of an aluminum wire. After PEO process the device measures the afterglow spectrum. These processes get repeated until we find under what synthesis conditions we get the most intense afterglow.

**TODO:**

- Write comments for spectroscope.py
- Write comments for all Arduino codes
- Test by sending instructions to each device independently
